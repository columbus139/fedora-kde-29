# Master Install Scripts

These are the full install scripts. This is an outline on how they work.

They start by updating the existing packages on the system.
Then add the sources that Spotify and VLC need (negativo17.org and RPMfusion respectively).
Then it installs the new software first.
Then removes the software that I don't use.
Discord Canary is downloaded and istalled (thanks to @AdrianKoshka on GitHub).
Then ClamAV's Antivrius Signatures are updated.
Finally, the system reboots (0.03 and newer).
